<p>This is a Karabiner configuration for macOS that remaps the Swiss keyboard layout to make it more ergonomic and efficient for both general use and development tasks (IDE).</p>

<h2>Mapped Keys</h2>

<h3>NORMAL MODE</h3>
<p>Basic Swiss keyboard layout adjustments. For example [ctrl+c = copy] and [ctrl+v = paste].</p>

<h3>DEV MODE</h3>
<p>For developers eager to keep their hands and fingers agile into their later years! Impacts IDEs exclusively. Accessing [], {}, and so on more easily.</p>
